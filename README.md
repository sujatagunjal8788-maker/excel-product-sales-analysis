## 💡 Key Insights
1️⃣ Day-wise Sales Trend

Sales are higher on weekends compared to weekdays.

Mid-week days (Tuesday–Wednesday) show relatively lower sales.
Insight: Promotional campaigns are more effective on weekends.

2️⃣ Sales vs Units Sold

Days with higher units sold generally generate higher total sales.

On some days, sales are high even with fewer units sold, indicating
high-value products were sold.
Insight: Focusing on high-priced products can significantly increase revenue.
3️⃣ Sales Representative Performance

A small group of sales representatives contributes to a large portion of total sales.

Some sales representatives show consistently low performance.
Insight: Best practices from top performers can be used to train underperforming reps.

4️⃣ Units Sold by City

Metro cities record significantly higher units sold.

Some cities show very low or zero units sold.
Insight: These cities may have low demand or distribution challenges.

5️⃣ City-wise Growth Opportunities

Low-performing cities can be targeted with localized marketing strategies.

High-performing cities require better inventory planning to avoid stock-outs.
Insight: City-level strategies can help improve overall sales performance
